# ascii-rocket-launch
A simple C++ console application animating a rocket launch.

This was one of the first programs I wrote when I was first learning to code in Spring 2019. As I was exploring the old files in my harddrive, I stumbled upon this the code I wrote over two years ago and decided to improve it. The result is contained in this repository.
